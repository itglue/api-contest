This Script is designed to run in Syncro and to take Passwords saved in all browsers and import them into ITGlue.

There are 2 global variables input through Syncro, $asset_name and $account_name which take the asset_name and account_name from Syncro respectively.

All programs go to the Path "C:\TechTools\pw" for ease of access and cleanup.
Programs needed to run the Script:
WebBrowserPassView.exe
psget.zip


Windows Defender sometimes blocks the programs from running. If this happens the script will fail. When this happens just wait a minute or 2 then run again. Built into the script is a line of code that creates an exclution in Windows Defender to prevent it from stoping the script.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The script should do 5 functions:
1. export the passwords from all browsers into a CSV file format
2. If the Company doesn't exist in ITGlue Inform the User to syncronize the Syncro Company to ITGlue
3. Import the CSV into the ITGlue using the API PowershellWrapper
4. Upload the CSV to the Asset on Syncro
5. Cleanup all the new programs and files added from running this script, with the exeption of the TechTools folder

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though the script is designed to work with the SyncroMSP it can be adapted to run on any MSP or even straight on Powershell.
To do this you need to add in the global variables $asset_name and $account_name
Next you need to have the computer in question store the programs psget.zip and WebBrowserPassView.exe in the path "C:\TechTools\pw"
And with that it has been adapted to whatever form is needed.
